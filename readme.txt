How to use 'makefile':
        make all    : this will compile the Doodle

=========================================


Here are the features of this paint program, Doodle.

1. Save a image into PNG file.
2. Load a PNG file to work on Doodle.
3. Color Buttons: you can change color by simply clicking the color buttons.
4. Thickness Slider:
        you can choose thickness of stroke.
5. GUI Area:
        Color & Thickness of Stroke will be shown with respect to GUI design.
        If you drag up in GUI area, the stroke will decrease.
        If you drag down in GUI area, the stroke will increase.
        If you click twice in GUI area, the JColorChooser will appear and let you choose any color you like. 
6. Clear Button:
        by clicking clear button, the drawing area will be cleared.
7. Eraser Button:
        by changing to white color, you can erase what you have drawn.
        It is represented with white circle and black background in GUI area.
8. Spring Button:
        by clicking once, you will activate an drawing of spring that will follow your mouse until you click the button twice.  Personally I think you can draw cool looking spring with this button. In order to make it cooler, I suggest you to decrease the thickness of the stroke.
9. Playback Slider:
        By scrubbing slider, you can see history of your drawing.
        By pressing left&right arrow button of your keyboard, you can play your drawing in order as you drawn.
10. Start button:
        By pressing Start button, you will be able to view your drawing with   accurate representation of time.
11. Pause button:
        click one = pause the play, click twice = replay the play
12. End button:
        By clicking end button, you will see the last drawing of yours.
13. Undo button:
        By clicking undo button, you will undo 9/10 parts of your drawing.

COMMENTS for grader.

I have noticed, this program runs much smoother in Mac environment with terminal, compared to linux environment with X11.
Hope you enjoy my paint application, Doodle.
Thanks for playing!
